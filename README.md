## How to find a location's volume
Sanborn maps are organized into "volumes" which are a group of maps covering a rectangular area of a city. Since I haven't created a digital map index that points to each location's volume, you'll need to find another way to locate a volume. 

Use one of the below methods to locate a volume and, if it's not listed above, then search for it on the Library of Congress's website.

### Chicago (two methods)
1. Dennis McClendon, map maker who founded Chicago Cartographics, has a [graphical map index](http://chicagoinmaps.com/LOCsanbornsguide.html) to the Library of Congress's website for each volume. This is the best method.

2. the Chicago Public Library has an [index of Chicago Sanborn map volumes](https://www.chipublib.org/chicago-sanborn-maps-index/) organized by community area. Now, the CPL has a link to black & white maps, which are helpful because the Library of Congress doesn't have color maps for all eras.  

### Outside Chicago
Search the [Library of Congress Sanborn map collection](https://www.loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps/) for your city's name. Search for county name if city results come up empty.
